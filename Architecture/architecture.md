# Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes is a powerful, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Understanding its architecture is crucial for effectively deploying and managing applications
in a Kubernetes cluster. This README provides an overview of the key components and concepts that make up the Kubernetes architecture.

## Kubernetes Components

Kubernetes architecture is divided into two main components: the Master Node and the Worker Nodes.

### Master Node Components

The Master Node is the control plane responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster. It includes several key components:

- **API Server (`kube-apiserver`):** The API Server is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API and serves as the central management entity.

- **etcd:** A distributed key-value store used for storing all cluster data. It provides a reliable way to store data needed to manage the cluster.

- **Controller Manager (`kube-controller-manager`):** This component runs various controllers that handle routine tasks in the cluster, such as replication, endpoint management, and node management.

- **Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`):** The Scheduler is responsible for assigning nodes to newly created pods based on resource requirements and other constraints.

### Worker Node Components

Worker Nodes run the containerized applications and consist of the following components:

- **Kubelet:** An agent that runs on each worker node. It ensures that containers are running in a Pod and reports back to the Master Node.

- **Kube-proxy:** A network proxy that runs on each node and ensures proper communication between pods and services.

- **Container Runtime:** Software responsible for running the containers. Kubernetes supports various container runtimes, including Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.

## Key Concepts

### Pods

Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes and consist of one or more containers that share storage and network resources. Each pod has a unique IP address within the cluster.

### ReplicaSets

ReplicaSets ensure that a specified number of identical pods are running at any given time. They provide scalability and fault tolerance by maintaining the desired number of pod replicas.

### Deployments

Deployments are higher-level abstractions that manage ReplicaSets and provide declarative updates to applications. They enable rolling updates and rollbacks.

### Services

Services provide stable endpoints to access pods. They enable load balancing and service discovery, ensuring that applications can communicate reliably within the cluster.

### Volumes

Volumes provide persistent storage for pods. Kubernetes supports various volume types, including hostPath, NFS, and cloud-provider-specific volumes like AWS EBS and GCE Persistent Disk.

### Namespaces

Namespaces are virtual clusters within a Kubernetes cluster. They provide a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams, offering a scope for names and isolation.

## Cluster Communication

Kubernetes components communicate with each other primarily through the API Server. The API Server processes RESTful requests and updates etcd, which acts as the single source of truth for the cluster state. Components like the Scheduler and Controller Manager interact with the API Server to perform their respective functions.
